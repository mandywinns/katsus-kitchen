             <div class="pancake">Banh xeo, a Vietnamese savory pancake, is a beloved street food renowned for its crispy texture and aromatic filling. The batter, made from rice flour, turmeric powder, coconut milk, and water, is poured onto a hot skillet, where it sizzles and crisps up to form a golden, lacy crepe. Typically filled with a mixture of savory ingredients such as shrimp, pork slices, bean sprouts, and green onions, banh xeo bursts with contrasting flavors and textures in every bite.</div>

             <li>Prepare the Batter: In a mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of rice flour, 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder, 1 cup of coconut milk, and 1 1/4 cups of water. Whisk until you have a smooth batter. Let the batter rest for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
             <li>Cook the Filling: Heat a skillet over medium heat and add a bit of oil. Stir-fry the pork slices and shrimp until they are cooked through, then add the chopped green onions and bean sprouts. Stir-fry for another minute until the vegetables are just wilted. Remove the filling from the skillet and set it aside.</li>  
             <li>Cook the Pancakes: Heat a non-stick skillet or a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add a teaspoon of oil and swirl it around to coat the bottom of the skillet. Ladle some of the batter into the skillet, tilting it to spread the batter thinly and evenly. Add a portion of the cooked filling onto one half of the pancake.</li>
             <li>Fold and Cook: Let the pancake cook until the edges start to crisp up and pull away from the skillet, and the bottom is golden brown. Fold the pancake in half to cover the filling and press down gently. Cook for another minute until the pancake is crispy and golden brown on both sides.</li>
             <li>Serve: Slide the banh xeo onto a serving plate and repeat the process with the remaining batter and filling. Serve the banh xeo immediately with a side of fresh lettuce leaves, herbs like mint, cilantro, and Thai basil, and nuoc cham dipping sauce. To eat, tear off a piece of the banh xeo, place it on a lettuce leaf along with some herbs, and roll it up before dipping it into the nuoc cham sauce.</li>
