        Ca kho to is a traditional Vietnamese dish that features caramelized 
        fish simmered in a clay pot with a savory sauce. The dish typically 
        starts with catfish or another firm-fleshed fish, which is marinated in 
        a then pan-fried until it develops a rich golden color before being braised in a 
        flavorful caramel sauce made from fish sauce, sugar, shallots,
        and sometimes coconut water or soda. This slow cooking
        process allows the fish to absorb the sweet and savory flavors of the sauce while becoming tender and succulent.</div>
   <div class="tradition">
        The resulting dish is a harmonious blend of sweet, savory, and umami flavors, 
        with the caramelized fish boasting a delightful contrast of texturesâ€”crispy on the outside
        and tender on the inside. Ca kho to is often served hot with steamed rice, allowing diners 
        to savor the fragrant sauce alongside the perfectly cooked fish. Its popularity extends beyond 
        Vietnam, as it has become a beloved dish among Vietnamese communities worldwide, cherished for its 
        comforting taste and cultural significance.

    <div class="family">Steps</div>
        <ol>
         <li>Prepare the Fish: Start by cleaning the fish and cutting it into serving-sized pieces. Pat the fish dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.</li>
         <li>Marinate the Fish: In a bowl, mix together fish sauce, minced garlic, black pepper, and a bit of sugar. Coat the fish pieces with this marinade, ensuring they are evenly covered. Let the fish marinate for about 15-30 minutes to allow the flavors to penetrate.</li>
         <li>Caramelize the Sugar: In a clay pot or a heavy-bottomed skillet, heat some oil over medium heat. Add sugar to the pot and let it melt and caramelize, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Once the sugar turns a deep amber color and becomes fragrant, add sliced shallots and stir-fry briefly until they are aromatic.</li>
         <li>Add the Fish: Carefully place the marinated fish pieces into the pot, arranging them in a single layer. Allow them to sear for a few minutes on each side until they develop a golden brown crust.</li>
         <li>Make the Sauce: Once the fish is seared, pour in a mixture of water or coconut water, fish sauce, and a bit more sugar. The liquid should just cover the fish. Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer.</li>
         <li>Simmer: Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let the fish simmer gently for about 20-30 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and the sauce has thickened slightly. Stir occasionally to ensure the fish cooks evenly and to prevent sticking.</li>
         <li>Serve: Once the fish is cooked, taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning if needed. Serve the ca kho to hot, garnished with chopped green onions or cilantro if desired. Enjoy it with steamed rice and perhaps some pickled vegetables on the side for a complete meal.</li>
