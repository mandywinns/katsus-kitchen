      <ol>
           <li>Prepare the Marinade: In a bowl, combine fish sauce, minced lemongrass, crushed garlic, chopped shallots, sugar, black pepper, and any optional ingredients like soy sauce or honey. Mix well until the sugar is dissolved and the flavors are evenly distributed.</li>
           <li>Marinate the Beef: Place thinly sliced beef into the marinade, ensuring each piece is coated evenly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer the beef and marinade into a sealable plastic bag. Refrigerate and let the beef marinate for at least 30 minutes, or ideally up to 2 hours, to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.</li>      
           <li>Preheat the Grill: Meanwhile, preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If you're using wooden skewers, soak them in water for about 30 minutes to prevent them from burning during grilling.</li>        
           <li>Skewer the Beef: Thread the marinated beef slices onto skewers, shaking off any excess marinade. Leave a bit of space between each slice to ensure even cooking.</li>   
           <li>Grill the Beef: Place the skewers on the preheated grill and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the beef is cooked to your desired level of doneness and develops a nice char on the outside. Avoid overcooking to keep the beef tender and juicy.</li>      
           <li>Prepare the Dipping Sauce: While the beef is grilling, prepare the dipping sauce by combining fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, and chili in a small bowl. Adjust the ingredients to taste, balancing the sweet, salty, sour, and spicy flavors.</li>
           <li>Serve: Once the beef skewers are cooked, transfer them to a serving platter. Garnish with fresh herbs like cilantro, mint, and Thai basil. Serve hot with the dipping sauce on the side, along with lettuce leaves, rice paper, vermicelli noodles, and sliced vegetables for wrapping and dipping. Enjoy the succulent and flavorful suong nuong!</li>
